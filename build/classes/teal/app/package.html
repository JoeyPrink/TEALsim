This package rovides base classes and interfaces for the generic application <i>SimPlayerApp</i> and stand-alone applications.  
A SimPlayer “plays” a TSimulation instance—that is it takes as input a TSimulation object and presents that 
TSimulation to the viewer.  It implements the TFramework interface, which is the glue that holds all of 
the components in the TSimulation together.
