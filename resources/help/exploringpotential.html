		<p>
You are the yellow avatar and you are exploring the plane shown.  Where ever you are, your height above the plane
indicates the potential at that point in the plane.  The yellow arrow just below you or above you in the plane indicates the direction of the total electric field
in the plane.  

<p>The electric field and potential are produced by two point
charges somewhere in the plane shown, both with the same magnitude of charge, but either both are positive, 
both are negative, or one is negative and one is positive, with equal probability.  Your job is to walk around the plane, as explained below, exploring the
potential, until you figure out what the charges of the two charges are.  

		</p>
<p>You can move to explore the potential using the keypad on the top right, taking note that the navigation balls in the 3D scene
correspond to the colors on the keypad.  That is, if you want to move toward the red ball in the scene press the red keypad button.  
</p>
<p>
Once you think you know what the charges are that produce this potential see if your guess is correct by clicking in the appropriate radio button next to your guess.  If you 
wrong you will be penalized 40 points.  The object of the game is to find out the charges with the smallest number of moves.  

<p>If you left click and drag in the scene you can change the view angle.  Each move increases your score by one point unless you have already visited the square you are
moving onto, in which case there is no increment in score.  </p>
