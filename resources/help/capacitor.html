     	<p>This simulation illustrates the interaction of charged 
           particles inside the two plates of a capacitor. Each 
           plate contains twelve charges interacting via the Coulomb 
           and Pauli forces, where one plate contains positive 
           charges and the other contains negative charges. Because 
           of their mutual repulsion, the particles in each plate 
           are compelled to maximize the distance between one another, 
           and thus spread themselves evenly around the outer edge 
           of their enclosure. However, the particles in one plate 
           are attracted to the particles in the other, so they 
           attempt to minimize the distance between themselves 
           and their oppositely charged correspondants. Thus, they 
           distribute themselves along the surface of their bounding 
           box closest to the other plate.
