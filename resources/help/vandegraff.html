     	<p>This simulation shows the charging of a Van de Graff Generator 
                          to a positive potential when there is a stationary positive 
                          charge sitting above it (resting on a plastic square). 
                          The presence of that charge means that we have to do 
                          more work than normal to charge up the generator. If 
                          the positive charge above the generator has charge q 
                          and the generator has radius a and is charged to a total 
                          charge Q, the energy we must put in to charge up the 
                          generator is:</p>
                        <img hspace="200" src="eq01.jpg" width="100" height="48"> 
                        <p>This total amount of energy is stored in the electrostatic 
                          field surrounding the generator after it is charged. 
                          As we charge it, there is a Poynting flux outward from 
                          the region where we are creating electromagnetic energy. 
                          This region is where the charge is being moved against 
                          the electric field on the conveyer belt (inside the 
                          cylindrical shaft of the generator). This region is 
                          where the creation rate per unit volume for electromagnetic 
                          energy (-J dot E), is positive. Energy is created there 
                          and flows out to fill the space around the generator. 
                          This energy flow can be seen in the motion of the electric 
                          field lines, which always move in the direction of the 
                          Poynting flux. </p>
                        <p>Pressing &quot;Start&quot; after charging the generator 
                          releases the stationary positive charge sitting above 
                          the generator. If there is enough electrostatic repulsion 
                          to overcome gravity, that charge will move upward. We 
                          can see that the source of its increasing kinetic energy 
                          and gravitational potential energy is the electrostatic 
                          field, because again we see the flow of energy out of 
                          that field, as indicated by the motion of the electric 
                          field lines. Since we have no energy dissipation in 
                          the system, the charged particle will eventually come 
                          to rest at some distance above the generator, and then 
                          start to fall back, transferring gravitational potential 
                          energy and kinetic energy back into the electrostatic 
                          field, as shown by the field line motion.</p>
                        <p>The graph shows the energy stored in the electrostatic 
                          field (not including the self energy term proportional 
                          to Q^2) and the sum of the gravitational potential energy 
                          and the kinetic energy of the charge. The sum of these 
                          is the total energy of the charge: gravitational potential, 
                          plus electrostatic potential, plus kinetic energy, and 
                          is constant as long as we keep Q constant. </p>
