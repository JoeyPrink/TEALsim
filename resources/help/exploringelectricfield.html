		<p>
You are the yellow avatar and you are exploring the electric potential in the plane shown.  Where ever you are, you can ask to show the 
potential at your current position and in all neighboring squares.  When the game starts, you are at the center of the playing field and
you can see the potential where you are and in the squares around you.  

<p>The electric field and potential are produced by two point
charges somewhere in the plane shown, both with the same magnitude of charge, but either both are positive, 
both are negative, or one is negative and one is positive, with equal probability.  Your job is to move to new positions in the plane, as explained below, exploring the
potential, look at the potentials in neigboring squares, and guess what the invisible charges are, in as few moves as possible.  

		</p>
<p>Before you can move to a new position, you must correctly deduce the direction of the electric field at your current position from
the potentials you see around you, using the upper keypad, taking note that the navigation balls in the 3D scene
correspond to the colors on the keypad.  That is, if you think the electric field at your current position points closest to 
the direction of the red ball in the scene, press the red keypad button.  After you have correctly guessed the electric field at your current
position you can then move to a new position in the plane, using the lower keypad.  You can move anywhere you want in the plane with no penalty.  
When you want to see the potential at the new point, press the "Show Potential Around Current Position".
<p>
Once you think you know what the charges are that produce this potential see if your guess is correct by clicking in the appropriate radio button next to your guess.  If you 
wrong you will be penalized 4 points.  The object of the game is to find out the charges with the smallest number of potential regions explored.  

<p>If you left click and drag in the scene you can change the view angle.    </p>
