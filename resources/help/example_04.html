<b>In this example, we create two electromagnetic objects which interact.  The first is 
a charge which is free to move along the vertical axis.  The second is 
a charge which is fixed in space, lying below a "wall" from which the free charge can bounce.  Gravity is downward. 
<br><br> 
We can vary the amount of the fixed-in-space charge to change the height of the free charge
above the wall.  
This simulation has a large friction so that the free charge "settles down" quickly to a equlibrium position when adjusting 
to changes in the charge on the fixed-in-space charge.  
<br><br>
The charge on the fixed-in-space charge can be varied between -10 and 10 charge units, where a charge unit 
is 2.975 micro Coulombs.  The charge on the floating charge is constant at 1 charge unit, its radius is 0.2 
meters and its mass is 0.035 kg.  The force of gravity on the floating charge, mg, is 0.343 Newtons.  
<br><br>
For a fixed-in-space charge of about 4.4 charge units the upward electrostatic repulsion when the 
floating charge is resting on the wall (center 1 meter above the fixed-in-space charge) will just about 
balance the downward force of gravity, and the floating charge will levitate above the wall for values 
of the charge on the fixed-in-space charge above this value.
