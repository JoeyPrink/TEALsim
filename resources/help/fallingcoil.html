     	<p>This simulation shows the dynamics of a conducting non-magnetic 
                          ring falling on the axis of a fixed magnet. As the ring 
                          falls under gravity towards the magnet, the changing 
                          magnetic flux through the ring gives rise to a current 
                          which is in a direction such as to slow the fall of 
                          the ring, by Lenz's Law. The ring has mass m, resistance 
                          R, and self-inductance L, and the magnet has magnetic 
                          dipole moment M. You can vary the resistance of the 
                          ring and the strength of the magnetic dipole moment 
                          to see how these parameters affect<br>
                          the dynamics of the ring. If the resistance is zero 
                          and the dipole moment is strong enough, the ring will 
                          levitate above the magnet. If the resistance is non-zero, 
                          even though small, the ring will eventually fall past 
                          the magnet. We also show the induced current in the 
                          ring in the meter on the lower left. <br>
