     	<p>Simulates the interaction 
                          between charged particles, and illustrates the electric 
                          fields generated as a result. Charges in the Zoo interact 
                          via the Coulomb force, with a Pauli repulsive force 
                          at close distances and a damping force proportional 
                          to velocity. The fields can be visualized in two ways: 
                          a &quot;grass-seeds&quot; representation (click on &quot;Grass 
                          Seeds &quot;), or a traditional vector field representation 
                          (adjust the &quot;Field Visualization&quot; slider), 
                          in addition to the real time renderings of the local 
                          field around each particle.</p>
                        <p>Use Start button to start simulation. Use Pause button 
                          to pause simulation. Click and drag on any particle 
                          to change its position. Use &quot;Grass Seeds&quot; 
                          to get a &quot;grass-seeds&quot; representaton of the 
                          electric field. Use &quot;Equipotential Lines&quot; 
                          to get a representaton of the electric potential field. 
                          Select and click &quot;remove&quot; to remove charge. 
                          Use &quot;Add Random Positive&quot; and &quot;Add Random 
                          Negative&quot; to add a positive or negative charge, 
                          respectively. Use &quot;Toggle Field Lines on Selected&quot; 
                          to toggle fieldlines on the selected charge(s). Control-click 
                          to select multiple charges.<br>
