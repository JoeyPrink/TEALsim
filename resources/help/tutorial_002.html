		<p>
		In this tutorial, we show how to create a ring of current with no electromagnetic
		properties, and let it fall under gravity to collide with a "wall", and 
		bounce.  We plot the height of the ring of current as a function of time.  We
                also include friction and a slider to vary the amount of friction in the 
                simulation.
