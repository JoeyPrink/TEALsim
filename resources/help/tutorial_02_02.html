A simulation of a coil falling under gravity and bouncing off of a floor.
We also create a graph of the vertical position of the coil as a function of time.  
In addition, we add a slider that allows us to vary the amount of damping in the world.  
By setting the slider to a non-zero value, the user can get the height of the coil to decay exponentially.  
The user can set the amount of damping either by moving the slider or by entering a value in the box to the 
right of the slider <b> AND HITTING ENTER</b>.
