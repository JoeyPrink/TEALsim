     	<p>In this simulation, ten positively charged particles interact in 
     		two dimensions inside a pentagon-shaped box via the classical Coulomb 
     		force and the quantum mechanical Pauli force. The mutual repulsion felt 
     		by the charges compels them to maximize the distance between each other. 
     		In this case, maximal separation puts them at the corners of the pentagon 
     		and at the halfway points along the sides that connect them.
