     	<p>The Electrostatic Video Game is a simulation consisting 
                          of one charge that is free to move and two charges that 
                          are fixed at specific locations. Using the principles 
                          of Coulomb's Law, Pauli repulsion at close distances, 
                          and damping proportional to velocity, the objective 
                          of the game is to steer the moving charge around the 
                          maze to the exit in the lower right wall. This is accomplished 
                          by dynamically (in real time) changing the value of 
                          the charge on the moving particle in response to the 
                          forces acting on it due to the local electric field. 
                          By thinking about the the charges involved, and resulting 
                          fields, you should be able devise a strategy for guiding 
                          the particle to the exit.</p>
                        <p>Use the Start button to start simulation. Use Pause 
                          button to pause simulation. Use &quot;Player Charge&quot; 
                          slider in panel labeled &quot;Point Charge&quot; to 
                          change the charge of moving particle. Steer the moving 
                          particle around the maze (exit at lower right) by changing 
                          its charge.<br>
