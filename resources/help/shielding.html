	 electric field due to a free charge near an isolated conducting spherical shell with zero charge.  The free
	 charge can be inside or outside the shell.  We show the charges induced on the surfaces of the shell that
	 keep the electric field in the conductor zero.  We also give the user a choice between showing the total field
	 (that is the field due to the free charge and the induced charges), or the field due to the free charge alone, or the
	 charge due to the induced charges alone.
