     	<p>This simulation of an experiment in which 
                          an aluminum sphere sitting on the bottom plate of a 
                          capacitor is lifted to the top plate by the electrostatic 
                          attraction generated as the capacitor is charged. While 
                          the sphere is in contact with the lower plate, their 
                          surface charge densities are approximately equal. Thus, 
                          as the capacitor is charged, the charge density on the 
                          sphere increases proportional to the potential difference 
                          between the plates. In addition, energy flows into the 
                          region between the plates as the electric field builds 
                          up. This can be seen in the motion of the electric field 
                          lines as they move from the edge to the center of the 
                          capacitor.</p>
                        <p>As the potential difference between the plates increases, 
                          the sphere feels an increasing attraction towards the 
                          top plate, indicated by the increasing tension in the 
                          field as more field lines &quot;attach&quot; to it. 
                          Eventually this tension is enough to overcome the downward 
                          force of gravity, and the sphere is &quot;levitated&quot;. 
                          Once separated from the lower plate, the sphere's charge 
                          density no longer increases, and it feels both an attractive 
                          force towards the upper plate and a repulsive force 
                          from the lower one. The result is a net force upwards.</p>
                        <p>In this simulation we have placed a non-conducting 
                          barrier just below the upper plate to prevent the sphere 
                          from touching it and discharging.</p>
