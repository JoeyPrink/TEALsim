In this tutorial, we create two electromagnetic objects which interact, a ring of current which is free to move along the vertical axis, and a magnetic dipole which is fixed in space.  Gravity is downward.  We can vary the amount of current in the ring to change  the height of the ring of current above the dipole.  We also have a <i>wall</i> at the same position as the magnetic dipole.  The ring of current rests on this wall if there is no current in the ring or if the current in the ring is such that the ring cannot levitate above the dipole.
