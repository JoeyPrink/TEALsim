<!-- Description goes here no comment characters first sentance used as summary -->
Provides classes and interfaces for reading and writing simulation data to and from a network port. 
This functionallity allows you to drive a simulation using data input from a network port.  
For example, in the TeachSpinLV application we read data from a network port. That data is put on the
net by a real remote experiment that provides both current in coils and the location of a magnet
suspended from a spring.  This information from the real remote experiment is then fed into the 
local simulation and used to position the magnet and generate the appropriate fields in the 
simulation of the remote real experiment.  This functionality is currently implemented only in the 
TeachSpinLV application.
