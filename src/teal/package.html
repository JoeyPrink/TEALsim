The <i>TEALsim</i> application framework provides an infrastructure and development environment for the 
creation and presentation of simulations rendered in 3D.  Architecturally, <i>TEALsim</i> follows a 
“Model-View-Control” design pattern, with several major modules representing the three components:  
the simulation engines make up the “model”; the renderer and viewer make up the “view”; and the user 
interface makes up the “control.”   This set of packages provides the model-view-control classes that
underlie any simulation.  The simulations themselves and the resouces needed to support them (e.g. 3D objects,
help files, etc.) are found in the packages in <i>tealsim</i>.
