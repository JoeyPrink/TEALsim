<h1>TEALsim</h1>

<p><h2>Welcome</h2></p>

<p>This release is a snapshot of the current state of the TEALsim software and is considered a "for comment" release. We include three example simulations. We expect to make a more formal and engineered release soon and would appreciate comments ranging from general comments on architecture to specific recomendations that would improve the future release.</p>

<p>Please send comments to: teal-comment@mit.edu.</p>

<!--b>The release consists of the following:</b>

<p>The TEAL projects "for comment" release of TEALsim is now available for download.</p-->

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There have been numerous 2D physics applets, but very few in 3D. There are many situations in physics that are inherently three-dimensional. For example, vector cross products (e.g. v x B forces in electromagnetism) immediately invoke a third dimension. We present here simulations written using Java 3D for the interactive simulation of electromagnetic dynamics.</p>

<h2>About TEALsim</h2>
<p>The TEAL Simulation Framework is an environment for creating, presenting, and controlling simulations that represent physical and mathematical concepts. A single simulation may run as either a Java application or Applet.

The framework provides integrated core services which include; user interface components, plug-able application 'Look and Feel' templates, an HTML Browser, simple audio support, visualization tools, realtime 3D rendering, and a well defined simulation model.  Simulation components include a collection of rendered objects, geometric primitives, simple mechanical tools, and electromagnetic components and constructs designed to work within the simulation model and rendering system.  An additional feature of the framework is the ability to import and export application components and simulation state using XML.</p>

<p>An application designer builds a simulation by adding components to the framework, the components may represent objects to be simulated, GUI controls for object properties, visualization components, such as field lines or force vectors, application specific actions, and information to be presented via the browser. Default user interface templates and simulation engines may be used or application specific implementations may be created.</p>

<p>The simulation model, or engine, is resposible for the integration of the simulation.  Simulations may be be run using an internally generated time step or may be driven by external data read from a file or remote source.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p> TEALsim will run on any platform where there is a suitable <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">Java 2 1.4.X runtime environment</a> and the<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/downloads/index.html"> Java3D 1.2.x</a> or better extensions installed. TEALsim has been used successfully on many platforms, including Linux, UNIX, Windows 2000, XP and MacOSX.</p>
